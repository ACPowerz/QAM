The scripts included in this repository are an implementation of a basic **Quadrature Amplitude Modulation(QAM)** scheme.

![QAM Block Diagram.](https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/QAM-modulator.jpg)

To run the code, simply run ***RUN_QAM.m*** and fill out the required parameters (input files, sampling frequency, carrier frequency)  
 
 *The process are as follows*  
 1. Loading inputs
 2. Upsampling
 3. Modulation
 4. Demodulation
 5. Downsampling
 6. Audio Playback
